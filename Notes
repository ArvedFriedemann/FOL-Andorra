Unit Propagation for First Order Logic

Let VAR = {v1,v2,...} be an infinite set of variables. We assume a language with the following terms:
x is a term for x in VAR.
(a b) is a term, iff a and b are terms.

For notation, (a b c d) denotes the term (((a b) c) d)

there are some special terms needed, realised with specific bound variables.
(a = b) should denote an atom declaring the terms a and b to be equal. It holds that
(a = a) and a in VAR   or
((a b) = (c d)) and (a = b) and (c = d)
not (a = b) otherwise

There are furthermore two terms for connectives
a ^ b
a v b
They are commutative so they form a set of terms.
A Formula is assumed to be a conjunction on top level, with either terms or disjunctions as atoms.
